###Robocleaner - new generation robot vacuum cleaner

Robot vacuum cleaners are devices that automatically clean indoor spaces without the user's intervention. There are devices equipped with mops for cleaning hard surfaces using wet wipes or brushes, as well as window cleaners and models designed for removing dry debris. The duration of autonomous operation is an important criterion when choosing one. The higher this parameter, the larger the area the vacuum cleaner can clean on a full battery charge. On average, the device spends 1-3 minutes per 1 square meter, so for cleaning a 70 square meter area, it's advisable to choose a model that operates for more than 1 hour. If the device has a docking station, it will autonomously return to its base to recharge the battery and then continue the interrupted cleaning. For users prone to allergies, a fine filtration filter can be useful. It traps fine dust particles and prevents them from returning to the room with the air. Vacuum cleaners with room mapping capability can perform high-quality cleaning as they can access all available areas. The devices can be controlled via buttons on the body, a remote control, or a smartphone. The DNS online store offers a wide range of models from leading household appliance manufacturers. You will be able to purchase a robot vacuum cleaner that meets requirements in terms of functionality, useful features, and size.
