###DACC (DAC)
This blockchain project is primarily content-based and functions as a distributed file system. According to experts assessing startup potential, this has the potential to revolutionize the digital media industry. Currently, the technology, which is considered the next breakthrough in the blockchain industry, is already supported by numerous companies. Crypto Capital, FBG Capital, TRON, Consensus Capital, and some other projects are involved in its financing. The currency's market capitalization is no more than 2 billion dollars, and the most active exchange where it is listed is KuCoin.

####What is the feature?

According to the founders' vision, users will have complete control over content creation, access, sending, and storing early versions of it. However, the distinctive features of the currency do not significantly contribute to its growth; the token's value has been decreasing from month to month.
