###Trainer that adjusts to the level of the student

Are you familiar with the situation where you submit an assignment or task for review, and you have to wait for results for a week because the reviewer is busy? That's how things usually work in most in-person courses. At JavaRush, you'll get the results of your task evaluation in less than a second after clicking the 'Check' button.

There are plenty of good books on the Internet, but reading books alone won't make you a programmer. To become a programmer, you need to code a lot. JavaRush is an online course for learning Java programming, consisting of 80% practice. That's exactly what you need to become a Java programmer.

How can anyone learn solely from books in this day and age? Such an approach was innovative in the 17th century, but not in the 21st. JavaRush uses the latest methodologies to make your learning easier, more interesting, and more productive: visualization, storytelling, motivation, gamification, and another two dozen technologies you haven't even heard of.
